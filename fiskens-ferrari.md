<p>uknetweb contracted me to produce a mini-site that could be used to showcase a classic car for sale.  The site would also be the basis of a framework that could easily be used to generate a showcase for another vehicle. This lovely car was selling for around &pound;1 million. </p>
<p>I built the site using Flex and ActionScript and created a simple set of components to be used for each page, allowing the site to be re-skinned and updated quickly.</p>
