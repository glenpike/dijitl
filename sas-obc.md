<p>After I provided Surfers Against Sewage with a storyboard and concept which they used to obtain some funding, SAS commissioned me to create an educational resource that they could provide free of charge to UK schools in order to get their message across to  secondary school students. </p>
<p>I worked with SAS and a scriptwriter on the concept and story for this resource, which had to provide some educational value, then recorded the dialogue, which was sent to an animation team in London.</p>
<p>Taking the finished animations, I assembled these with educational resources using ActionScript and Flash to produce a story interspersed with activities and downloads for the viewers.</p>
<p>The resource was integrated with Analytics, enabling SAS to see the visits and goals completed.</p>
