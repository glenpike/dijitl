<p>My friends at Channel produced me a lovely logo and when I first saw it, I realised I could make space invader type characters out of the glyphs. </p>
<p>As an exercise in creative branding, I tried to put a new spin on an old classic game. I built space invaders using only the letters in the logo to create all the game sprites and added a scoreboard.</p>
