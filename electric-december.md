<p>I concieved, planned and ran a project to get kids to think about renewable energy in a creative way, using Flash animations and automata models as part of the Electric December project.</p>
<p>I ran four days of workshops with secondary school students where we taught them to make automata and do animation work in Flash. They were challenged to produce designs for objects based around the principle of the &quot;Conservation of Energy&quot;.</p>
<p>After the workshops, I produced the Flash website showcase as part of the Electric December online advent calendar and I had the honour of my work being chosen for 1st December. </p>
<p>To date, I think this is my most enjoyable project.</p>
