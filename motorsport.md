<p>I was contracted by uknetweb to work on the front end of a dvd application for displaying past issues of MotorSport magazine. The magazine were archiving all their old issues into digital format and wanted to provide a way for enthusiasts to read these old versions.</p>
<p>I was provided with a design and layout to make up an application that would load and display images of each page in the magazine and to also provide a search facility. I worked with uknetweb to find a solution and produced a PHP script that would extract the text from PDF files into files that could be loaded and searched in the application.</p>
<p>I built the application in Flex allowing it to be re-used to produce a number of archives by changing external XML files and the content to be loaded.</p>
