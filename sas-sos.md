<p>After the success of <a href="sas-obc">Operation Beach Clean</a>, Surfers Against Sewage asked me to create a second educational resource for Key Stage 2, primary school students.</p>
<p>Again I worked with SAS and a scriptwriter to come up with the story and then recorded the new dialogue. I re-used some of the animation from the OBC work and added new dialogue for the introduction, changing the lip-sync. I produced the other animation work myself and created additional games and activities for the students together with set of PDF's for teachers and students to download.</p>
