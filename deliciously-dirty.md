<p>uknetweb were asked to produce a Flash website in conjunction with a local design agency for a marketing campaign promoting Cornish 'Early' potatoes. The concept was that you could have 1.5kg of potatoes delivered to your door within 24 hours of being in the ground. I created the Flash website and PHP back-end allowing customers to order online. I also created a login area in the Flash site so the local farmers could see a wholesale price for the potatoes daily and not be beaten down by the supermarket buyers.</p>
<p>Skills: Flash, PHP, HTML, ActionScript 1</p>
