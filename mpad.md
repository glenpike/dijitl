<p>I worked with a local designer in creating a flash based website for a local PR company.
  The site was created with ActionScript 2 and used XML to configure a customised Tree Component menu, loading content dynamically.
  Content pages were totally separated from ActionScript code, allowing the site to be updated easily by MPAD in Flash.
  It used SWFObject to degrade nicely for non-flash users</p>
<p>Skills: Flash, ActionScript 2</p>
