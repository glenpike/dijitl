<p>I was contracted by Nixon to build this portal entry page selector for Nikon Instruments global website. The site was intended to help first time visitors choose their region which would then become their landing page in future.</p>
<p>I built the site in Flash re-using and refactoring some common code I had created for previous projects alongside custom code.</p>
<p>Skills: Flash, ActionScript 2.</p>
